# Implemented Canvas Group Management Methods

## Summary

We have successfully implemented both asynchronous and synchronous methods to support Canvas group management operations:

### Asynchronous Methods (Canvas Client)
1. `create_group_category` - Creates a new group category (group set) in a course
2. `update_group_category` - Updates an existing group category
3. `create_group` - Creates a new group within a group category
4. `update_group` - Updates an existing group
5. `set_group_members` - Sets the members of a group (overwrites existing members)

### Synchronous Methods (sync_utils.py)
1. `create_group_category_sync` - Synchronous version of create_group_category
2. `update_group_category_sync` - Synchronous version of update_group_category
3. `delete_group_category_sync` - Deletes a group category synchronously
4. `create_group_sync` - Synchronous version of create_group
5. `update_group_sync` - Synchronous version of update_group
6. `delete_group_sync` - Deletes a group synchronously
7. `push_group_memberships_sync` - Pushes group memberships to Canvas synchronously
8. `push_all_group_memberships_sync` - Pushes all group memberships for a course to Canvas

## Benefits

These encapsulated methods provide several benefits:

1. **Reusability**: The methods can be reused across different parts of the application
2. **Consistency**: They ensure consistent API calls and error handling
3. **Maintainability**: They make the codebase more maintainable by centralizing API logic
4. **Testability**: They facilitate testing of Canvas API integration
5. **Reliability**: The synchronous methods ensure operations complete fully before views return

## Implementation Details

### Asynchronous Methods:
- Use async/await for non-blocking operation
- Handle database updates to keep local records in sync
- Include proper type hints for improved code quality
- Follow the existing patterns in the Canvas Client class

### Synchronous Methods:
- Use the standard `requests` library instead of `httpx`
- Ensure API operations complete fully within the view function
- Follow the same parameter patterns as their async counterparts
- Designed specifically for use in Django views where mixing async/sync can cause issues

## Problem Resolution

The implementation of synchronous utility functions addresses a critical issue where group memberships were not properly pushed to Canvas. Previously:

1. Group categories and groups were being created in Canvas correctly
2. Student assignments to groups were saved in the local database
3. However, the student assignments were not consistently pushed to Canvas

The issue stemmed from mixing asynchronous and synchronous code in Django views. The asynchronous operations were initiated but might not complete before the view returned. By implementing synchronous versions, we ensure that the API operations complete fully before returning to the user.

## Views Updated

The following views have been updated to use the synchronous methods:

1. `create_group_set` - Now uses `create_group_category_sync`
2. `edit_group_set` - Now uses `update_group_category_sync`
3. `delete_group_set` - Now uses `delete_group_category_sync`
4. `create_group` - Now uses `create_group_sync`
5. `edit_group` - Now uses `update_group_sync`
6. `delete_group` - Now uses `delete_group_sync`

Additionally, group membership assignment views have been updated:

1. `add_student_to_group` - Now calls `push_group_memberships_sync`
2. `remove_student_from_group` - Now calls `push_group_memberships_sync`
3. `batch_assign_students` - Now calls `push_group_memberships_sync` for each modified group
4. `random_assign_students` - Now calls `push_group_memberships_sync` for each modified group

We've also added a dedicated view for pushing all group memberships to Canvas:
- `push_course_group_memberships` - Uses `push_all_group_memberships_sync`

## Documentation

The following documentation has been updated or created:

1. `docs/canvas/client.md` - Updated with both async and sync methods
2. `dev_docs/canvas/implementation_guide_group_management.md` - Updated with implementation details and testing instructions

## Results

With these changes:
1. Group sets and groups are correctly created in both the local database and Canvas
2. Student assignments to groups are properly synchronized to Canvas
3. The Canvas UI now shows students in their assigned groups
4. The manual "Push Memberships" feature provides a way to force synchronization if needed
