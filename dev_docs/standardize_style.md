1. Create a CSS Variables System
    - Define all brand colors, spacing, and typography as CSS variables in a central location
    - Replace hardcoded values with these variables throughout the codebase
    - Example file: /static/css/variables.css
  2. Implement a Component-Based CSS Structure
    - Reorganize CSS into logical components (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
    - Follow BEM methodology for class naming
    - Create separate files for each component type
  3. Reduce Inline Styles
    - Move inline styles from templates to component CSS files
    - Use utility classes for one-off styling needs
  4. Standardize Color Usage
    - Create semantic color variables (primary-action, info-text, etc.)
    - Document when each color should be used
  5. Establish a Responsive Strategy
    - Create standardized breakpoints
    - Document responsive patterns for components
  6. Create a Style Guide Page
    - Build a reference page showing all components and styles
